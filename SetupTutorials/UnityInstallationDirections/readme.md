## What are the Unity Hub and Unity Editor?
To work with Unity, you'll start with the Unity Hub. The Unity Hub is a standalone application that streamlines the way you navigate, download, and manage your Unity projects and installations.
From the Hub, you'll download and manage various versions of the Unity Editor. The Unity Editor is the application where you'll build 3D or 2D worlds and create your interactive applications.
## System requirements
Make sure the computer you're using meets the minimum hardware requirements to run Unity. Generally, if you have a PC running Windows or a Mac running macOS that was purchased in the last few years, your computer is probably ready for Unity. Unity also runs on Linux. Unity will not run on a Chromebook or tablet.  
  
For details about the latest verified system requirements, refer to the [System Requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html) page in the Unity Manual.  
  
**Note**: While you can use Unity to build applications that run on many platforms, the Unity Editor requires Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Your Unity plan
If you'll use Unity as an individual, you'll be enrolled in a [Unity Personal](https://unity.com/products/unity-personal) plan by default. Unity Personal is Unity's standard free plan. Individuals, hobbyists, and small businesses using Unity to provide services to others are eligible to use Unity Personal if their respective clients, in the aggregate, have less than $200K of revenue or funds raised in the prior 12 months.  
  
If you are a student, enroll in the [Unity Student](https://unity.com/products/unity-student) plan and qualify for discounts and free resources.

## Your Unity account and organization
When you first run the Unity Hub, you'll be prompted to log in or create a Unity account.  
  
If you use Unity as an individual, then when you create a Unity account, you will be automatically assigned an organization that has the same name as your username and consists only of yourself. 
Later, use this default organization to purchase plan subscriptions, such as Muse (Unity's generative AI) or Unity Cloud services for your personal use only. 
In this case, be ready to specify a username and password to create your Unity account.
