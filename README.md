## Preparation:
Students are encouraged to read the "[Student Preparation](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Human--Computer-Interactions-VR-AR/tree/main/Student%20Preparation)" readme. This document provides essential instructions for setting up accounts and preparing your equipment for the course. Bringing your own equipment (computers, headsets, cables) is recommended, and staff will assist with setup to ensure a smooth learning experience. Minimum hardware requirements and setup details are included.

**If you are bringing your own hardware** you need to follow the directions in the [Student Preparation](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Human--Computer-Interactions-VR-AR/tree/main/Student%20Preparation) **before** coming to class.
